"""Supply currents from a simulated operating point. VENDORED.

⚠️ **THIS FILE IS VENDORED.** The master is `SPEC2SI_FLOWKIT/irdrop/
currents.py`; every consumer holds a byte-identical copy that `sync.py`
hash-checks. Change the master, re-vendor.

The companion to `solver.py`. That one turns a topology into volts; this
one turns a simulator's operating point into the amps the topology needs,
and it is shared for the same reason: a Spectre operating point is a
SIMULATOR format, not a PDK one. `Vdd:p` means the same thing at 65 nm,
28 nm and 110 nm.

What stays local is **how you get the numbers**: AIML reads PSF through
`wave.read_psf`, ONR has a text-oppoint reader in `tech/probes/
parse_oppoint.py`, and each flow names its supplies differently. Those
readers hand this module a plain `{name: value}` dict and it does the
three things that are the same everywhere and easy to get wrong.

THE THREE THINGS
----------------
1. **SIGN.** A voltage source's terminal current is negative when the
   source is delivering -- but which sign a given simulator, source
   orientation and save statement produce is not something to assume.
   `supply_load()` takes the MAGNITUDE and records that it did. What it
   will not do is silently accept a mixture: if some supplies come back
   positive and others negative, that is a bench with a source wired
   backwards, and it says so.

2. **UNITS.** PSF is SI (amps). A text operating point is NOT -- Spectre
   writes `27.8321 pA`, and the prefix is on the UNIT token, so a naive
   `float()` on the value alone mis-scales by twelve orders of magnitude
   and still looks like a number. `scale()` reads the prefix.

3. **COVERAGE.** ⚠️ **A NET WITH NO SIMULATED CURRENT RAISES.** It does
   not default to zero. Zero current is a valid answer -- a decoupling-
   only rail draws none -- but it has to be SAID, because "this net was
   not in the operating point" and "this net draws nothing" produce the
   same 0.000 mV and only one of them is true. `Currents.require()` is
   how a caller asserts the set it expects.

⚠️ WHICH NUMBER, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE NUMBER
----------------------------------------------
A DC operating point gives one current per supply. A transient gives
three, and they answer different questions:

  * `avg`  -- what an EM rule asks for. Every EM card in this flow states
             a DC/average limit and nothing else.
  * `rms`  -- Joule self-heating, which feeds back into the EM
             temperature derate. No card here states an RMS limit.
  * `peak` -- the worst-case IR drop, which is what a supply-sensitive
             block actually sees.

`Currents` carries a `kind` and refuses to be combined with a different
one, because averaging one block and taking the peak of another produces
a grid nobody simulated.
