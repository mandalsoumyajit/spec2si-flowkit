"""A DC resistive solver for supply grids. NODE-AGNOSTIC, VENDORED.

⚠️ **THIS FILE IS VENDORED.** The master is `SPEC2SI_FLOWKIT/irdrop/
solver.py`; every consumer holds a byte-identical copy that `sync.py`
hash-checks. Never edit a vendored copy -- change the master, re-vendor,
and let each consumer decide whether its adapter still holds.

WHY THIS ONE FILE IS SHARED WHEN THE ENGINE IS NOT
--------------------------------------------------
The flowkit's contract is deliberately narrow: the rule set is shared and
the engine is not, because the engines genuinely diverge (Calibre vs
PVS/Pegasus, PyCell vs SKILL, one substrate vs per-tub). This file is the
exception that proves the rule -- it touches no PDK, no deck, no PCell,
no card. It takes resistances in ohms and currents in amps and returns
volts. There is nothing in it that could differ between 65 nm, 28 nm and
110 nm, so three copies of it would be three chances to fix a bug twice.

What stays local is everything that knows about a process:

  * where the resistances come from (each node's own RC card, and the
    per-cut/per-square lookups that go with it);
  * where the currents come from (that node's own Spectre reader);
  * how the rail plan becomes a netlist (each repo's own topology).

Those three are the adapter each consumer writes. This is the solver.

WHAT IT SOLVES
--------------
Modified nodal analysis with no sources but current injections and ideal
voltage pins:

    G v = i,   G[a][a] += 1/R,  G[a][b] -= 1/R,  ...

pinned nodes are removed from the system and their contribution folded
into the right-hand side. Dense LU with partial pivoting, pure Python --
a few hundred nodes solve in milliseconds and it adds no dependency,
which matters because these repos run raw `python3` through a cluster
activation wrapper and a numpy import is not guaranteed there.

⚠️ **A FLOATING NODE IS AN ERROR, NOT A ZERO.** A node with no resistive
path to any pin makes the matrix singular. Solvers habitually paper over
this with a tiny conductance to ground, which turns an unconnected rail
-- a real and common topology bug -- into a plausible small voltage. This
one finds the unreachable nodes by traversal BEFORE factoring and raises
naming them, because "0.3 mV of drop" on a net that is not connected is
exactly the kind of clean-looking wrong answer these flows exist to
avoid.

⚠️ **UNITS ARE SI AND CHECKED.** Ohms, amps, volts. The EM cards on every
node speak milliamps, and the one thing guaranteed to produce a
believable wrong answer is a 1000x current. `Grid.inject_mA` exists so a
caller never has to write the conversion itself.
