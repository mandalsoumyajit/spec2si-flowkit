"""The SHARED documentation model: one parse, one link check, one freshness gate.

⛔ VENDORED. This file is a byte-identical copy of spec2si-flowkit's
`docs/docmodel.py`, hash-gated by that repo's `sync.py --check`. Edit it
THERE, never here.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE. Each process repo had, or wanted, its own
documentation generator, and a generator is two things welded together: a
MODEL (what the docs and the code actually say) and a BACKEND (how to render
it). The model is node-agnostic -- a docstring is a docstring on 65 nm and on
28 nm, and `docmeta` frontmatter is a contract all three repos already share
via `policy/docmeta.core.json`. The backend is not: it knows the repo's areas,
its machine-read JSON cards, its README block names.

So the model lives here and is vendored, exactly as the policy core is, and
each repo keeps a thin `docs/gen.py` that supplies its own configuration and
renders. That is what lets a second and third backend -- the web manual, the
PDF -- hang off the same parse instead of becoming a second extractor to keep
in step. See ADR-0001 and the packaging plan.

⚠ STDLIB ONLY, AND NO IMPORT OF THE SUBJECT CODE. The API reference is built
by STATIC AST parse because the engines need the PDK/Virtuoso/Calibre
environment that CI does not have. Both properties are load-bearing: they are
why the freshness gate can run on every PR with no dependency install and no
licence. Do not add a third-party import here; put it in a backend.

⚠ PYTHON FLOOR 3.6.8. The cluster runs raw system python with no pip. No
f-strings-with-`=`, no walrus, no `ast.unparse` without the guard below.

    2026-08-20 over the 372 modules and 2,366 public symbols the extractor

    781 K (of which the module docstrings alone are 462 K).

    Full bodies are the right answer for a paginated backend and the wrong
    one here: the API reference is EIGHT area pages, so `full` would put
    ~400 K in hybrid_adc.md alone -- past the size where GitHub renders
    Markdown at all. A paragraph is the natural summary unit, nearly doubles
    what is published, and stays inside one list item because it is joined.
