"""glue_solver -- the chip's signal router: a multi-tier maze search over the
track grid, allocated globally with bounded displacement.

⛔ WHY THIS REPLACES THE GREEDY PAIR ROUTER. `glue_route`'s first core chose
ONE (H, V) pair per net from `pairs_for` and drew exactly V-H-V on it, in one
fixed order, with no rip-up. 64 of 136 nets routed and the 71 failures were one
problem in three costumes -- measured on the committed snapshot:

    38  "no free lane within N um of A"   the pin's own column is taken
    21  "lanes exist but no track joins"  no single H track spans the run
    12  "the tap did not"                 trunk+tap is not a net topology

Every one of those is a consequence of the SHAPE, not of the search width. The
handoff measured the width to saturation (LANE_CAND x TRACK_SEARCH of 4x48,
10x200 and 16x400 route 64, 64 and 65): sixteen times the search buys one net,
because the lanes are not there to be found -- they are held by nets already
placed, and a route that may not bend more than twice cannot go round.

So two changes, both structural:

  1. ⭐ A ROUTE IS NOT A PAIR. The unit of feasibility was raised from a tier to
     a pair (GLUE_ROUTER_SCOPE 4) and that was right as far as it went, but a
     pair is still two tiers chosen ONCE for a whole net. Here every run picks
     its own tier from M5/M6/M7/M8 and a route may bend as often as the
     geometry wants. `pairs_for` still says which tiers can carry a BUNDLE; it
     no longer dictates each route.

  2. ⭐ ALLOCATION IS GLOBAL, NOT GREEDY. `routing.SolverLanes` solved this
     failure class one level down (an early wide-window claim squatting on a
     narrow-window net's only lanes) with bounded recursive displacement, and
     its bounds are inherited rather than re-invented: MAX_DEPTH 6, MAX_MOVES
     400. What is displaced here is a whole ROUTE rather than a lane, and the
     blockers come from the same A* that finds the path -- a SOFT search prices
     other nets' metal instead of forbidding it, so the path it returns names
     exactly who has to move. Nothing guesses and nothing re-derives.

⚠ WHAT IS KEPT, BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS A DEFECT ONCE:

  - the wire is `max(tier minimum, one via pad)`, not the deck minimum: a track
    a via cannot land on is not a routing track;
  - a via stack claims and checks pads on EVERY tier it passes through, one
    track either side, because those pads are off-grid on the tiers the route
    does not otherwise use;
  - a terminal's last run is at the PIN's own y, off-grid, straddling two
    tracks -- snapping it to a track centre left 34 nets as open islands;
  - a run claims PAD/2 past each end, because a cut at the end of a run puts
    metal half a pad past it;
  - every terminal's access stack is an obstacle to every other net.

`Tracks` lives here rather than in `glue_route` so there is ONE occupancy
model: the greedy control and the solver must not be able to disagree about
what is free.

Determinism: every candidate list is built in a fixed order, the priority
queue breaks ties on a monotonic counter (never on `id()`, which would make
the router's output depend on the allocator), and there is no randomness.

#: M5-M7 alternate H/V/H and all three are offered to every run.
#:  - M1-M4 are INSIDE the blocks. `chip_abstract.ROUTING_TIERS` carries them

#:    chip tier at all.
#:  - M9 is excluded by MEASUREMENT, not policy: GLUE_ROUTER_SCOPE 4 measured
#:    0 of 24 M9 tracks free in the readout window, because 2.4 um straps on a
#:    12 um pair pitch sterilise every candidate at a 2.0 um rule. It is a
#:    power tier here because there is nothing on it to route on.
#:  - ⭐ M8 WAS OFFERED AND IS NOT ANY MORE, on two independent grounds, and
#:    it costs NOTHING: with M8 the solver routes 136 of 136 in 634 cuts, and
#:    without it 136 of 136 in **584** cuts over 27,308 um instead of 27,322
#:    (it pays 60 displacements instead of 3, which is search, not silicon).
#:      1. THE VIA IS NOT THE VIA THIS FILE PRICES. Every rung here is a
#:         `bd.VIA["VIA1"]` -- cut 0.100, enclosure 0.020, pad 0.140. True of
#:         VIA5 and VIA6; VIA7 crosses into the thick tiers and the signed
#:         block draws it at **0.360 with 0.120 of enclosure**, a 0.600 pad. A
#:         route that reserves 0.140 and draws 0.600 takes metal from its
#:         neighbours: measured, 78 VIA7 cuts produced 6 M7 shorts between
#:         routed nets and 5 more against `bias`, plus 2 pads inside the DAC
#:         keep-out. Every one of them is an artifact of the model, not of the
#:         routing.
#:      2. ⛔ M8 IS THE POWER MESH'S OWN TIER AND THE ROUTER CANNOT SEE THE
#:         MESH. `Tracks` is built from `chip_obstacles.json`, which is the
#:         BLOCKS; the chip's own 324 M8 mesh segments and 45 ladders are
#:         drawn by the merge and are in no map this router reads. A signal on
#:         M8 is therefore routed blind against the densest chip-level metal
#:         there is.
#:    Restoring M8 needs a per-LEVEL pad in `claims`/`pad_tracks`/`_stack_ok`
#:    and the mesh in the obstacle map -- both real work, neither of which buys
#:    a net.
#: ⚠️⚠️ **AND AT 28 nm THESE NUMBERS ARE M5, M6, M7 -- WHICH IS ALMOST
#: RIGHT BY ACCIDENT.** The 65 nm file meant M5-M7 and the layer INDEX is the
#: same here, so the constant transferred as three of the four tiers this
#: tile wants. M8 is added, and every one of the four reasons above has been
#: re-checked against this node rather than inherited:
#:
#:   * M1-M4 inside the blocks -- still true, and M5/M6 are only 9.1 % and
#:     14.7 % occupied, which is a working condition rather than a wall.
#:   * M9 excluded -- still excluded, for the opposite reason: it is EMPTY
#:     here, and that is why the tile's supply trunks took it.
#:   * the VIA is not the via this file prices -- **fixed**: `wire_w` and
#:     every reach ask `ca.via_pad(tier)` now, so a rung on M7/M8 reserves
#:     `VIA7`/`VIA8`'s pad and one on M5 reserves `VIA5`'s.
#:   * M8 is the power mesh's tier and the router cannot see the mesh --
#:     **fixed**: the tile's comb is drawn FIRST and handed in through
#:     `adc_8bit_async_ms_redundant_v3.supply_pg()`.

        -> (lo, hi) such that any run with both endpoints inside it is legal
        WITH its pad overhang, or None when `p` itself is blocked.

        ⛔ THE WINDOW IS INSET BY THE OVERHANG, not by the wire alone. A run
        claims PAD/2 past each end (a cut at the end of a run puts metal half a
        pad past it), so a window computed from the wire alone lets the router
        place an endpoint whose own pad already sits in someone else's
        clearance. That is the class the last session closed three times; it
        costs one `+ pad` here and nothing anywhere else.

        `ks` is a LIST because an off-grid run straddles the tracks
        `straddle()` names; the window is the intersection over all of them.
        `soft` prices other nets rather than obeying them, so only the obstacle
        map bounds the window.

        ⛔ `anchor` IS THE PIN, AND WITHOUT IT THE ROUTER REFUSES NETS AT THEIR
        OWN TERMINALS. The obstacle map carries no nets -- a block's own PORT
        metal is a rectangle exactly like any other -- so at an access point
        the map reports the pin as blocking the pin. Measured: `qdi_tier`'s
        east ports sit at x 503.270 and the M5 shape under them runs
        502.750..503.270, so `eng_*`, `done_*`, `dec_clk`, `cdone` and the
        whole `dn*` bus were refused at a terminal `pin_access` had already
        PROVED a via stack stands on -- and, worse, the same test made the far
        terminal unreachable, so A* searched the region to exhaustion before
        saying so (30-60 s per net).

        `pin_access` is the arbiter for that pad, having checked it with the
        block's own metal excluded. So the pad is GIVEN: an obstacle that
        reaches into it does not veto the window, it only says which way the
        wire may leave -- left of the pin, right of it, or (straddling) not at
        all. Everything beyond the pad clears normally.

    wherever the wide metal would stand inside the via rule's halo of one of
    the NET'S OWN terminal climbs.

    ⭐ THE RULE IS THE DECK'S, NOT A PREFERENCE -- see LAND_TAPER. A climb is
    drawn by `glue_draw.climbs()` from the pads `pin_access` measured, one
    0.100 cut per rung, and `VIAn.R.4` charges that cut a second it cannot
    hold whenever a plate wider than VIA_WIDE stands within VIA_HALO of it.
    So the test is PROXIMITY, not endpoint identity: with the stub cap the
    wide trunk no longer ends AT the terminal -- it ends at a stub join, or
    passes beside its own landing one track over -- and an endpoint lookup
    that misses by 0.01 um leaves the plate in the halo. A run is narrowed
    over `along +- LAND_TAPER` of every own terminal whose across-distance
    puts the wide metal inside the halo; thin metal (< VIA_WIDE) is never a
    plate, whatever its distance.

    ⚠ OWN terminals only: D.6/E.5 measured every `VIAn.R.*` result on the
    widened net's own cuts and none across nets, so the rule is scoped to
    the connection and a net-blind taper would answer a question the deck
    does not ask.

    ⚠ A wide sliver shorter than PAD_ALONG between two thin windows (or
    against a run end) is drawn thin as well -- it would be all rule
    exposure and no ohms.

    ⛔ AND THE WINDOW IS THE CUT'S, NOT ONLY THE TERMINAL'S. The landing CUT
    stands wherever the off-grid stub put it -- up to MAX_STUB from the
    access point -- and LAND_TAPER's PAD_ALONG/2 allowance covers a bar, not
    a stub. Measured (sig14): `topp`'s landing cut sat 0.41 um past its
    terminal, the taper ended 0.63 um past the CUT against the deck's 0.8
    halo, and the deck answered `VIA5.R.4:M5 x1` at 551.95,149.47 -- the ONE
    result on a chip that was otherwise the signed baseline. So every own
    cut (`cuts`, the route's stacks) inside a terminal's window re-centres a
    window of its own. Cuts elsewhere on the net -- the mid-route climbs the
    via ARRAYS serve -- are untouched: a terminal window must reach a cut
    before the cut extends it, so the taper cannot creep down the trunk.
