    ⛔⛔ **THIS IS THE GATE FOR A CHANGE THE CORPUS CANNOT SEE.** Where a
    caller sets no `term_span`, `lo == hi == at` and both expressions give
    the same number, so a replay is byte-identical BY CONSTRUCTION -- which
    makes it a control that proves nothing, the exact shape this project has
    been caught by three times. What has to be shown is that the two
    branches DIFFER once a span IS supplied.

    The defect: a pin goal's `lo..hi` is the certified RUNWAY, a lane
    measured free of blockers. `_reach` clamped the arrival into it, so a
    drop column standing anywhere inside the lane gave `qx == lx` and a stub
    of ZERO length -- the pin joined to nothing, while `contact()` reported
    a gap of 0.0000 um because it reads the same interval. Measured on
    spec2si-tsmc28's sub-ADC tile 2026-08-27: 42 of 65 on-tier pins reached
    by no metal.

    ⚠️ AND THE CONDUCTOR'S NEAR EDGE IS NOT THE ANSWER EITHER. Stopping
    there leaves the claim short of the anchor, so `legal`'s anchor test
    never matches, the span is never unioned into the window, and the route
    is refused at the gate: 69 routed became 33 on that tile. The stub has
