"""The cross-session AGENT-LOOP occurrence log -- verify_log's counterpart.

`analog/specs/verify_log.jsonl` records what the TOOLS said: 206 DRC/LVS
verdicts, deck-hash partitioned, classified against one RULE_TABLE. There is
no equivalent for the loop that PRODUCED those verdicts. That history lives in
289 KB of RESUME.md prose, and the claims we make from it are the ones that
justify the whole two-tier gate architecture:

    "~10 offline iterations for zero cluster runs; six prior blind cluster
     attempts had failed."
    "via_plates reproduced lock_detector_1's last marker in milliseconds
     after three sessions of cluster round trips had failed to close it."

Both are quoted from memory. Neither sits in a file that can be counted. We
are running a long, expensive experiment in AI-driven design with no
experimental record of it (docs/sable_comparison.md 4.4).

WHAT THIS IS
    One record per ATTEMPT: a turn of the agent loop that touched a known
    cell. The skeleton is HARVESTED (how many actions, how long, how many
    failed, which files, offline or cluster) because the transcript is the
    one chokepoint written unconditionally -- the same reason agentview
    tails it instead of hooking PreToolUse. The TERMINAL CAUSE is DECLARED,
    from a fixed enumeration, because it is a judgement and inferring it
    would be inventing data.

    A harvested-but-unclassified attempt is not a gap in the log, it is a
    measured backlog: stats prints the count, so "we have not classified
    anything in three weeks" is visible instead of silent. Same contract as
    verify_log -- THE LOG DECIDES NOTHING. It counts.

=============================== NDA ========================================
Every field here is METADATA. The transcript is read only through
agentview's allowlist (`_SAFE_INPUT_KEYS`), so tool output, file contents,
commands and message bodies are never seen by this module either. Paths are
reduced to a cell name and basenames before they are written.

`note` is the one free-text field and it is agent-written, so it inherits the
repo's disclosure predicate (docs/threat_model.md I1): a rule IDENTIFIER may
be written down, a rule VALUE may not. `NOTE_MAX` caps it, and note_is_safe()
rejects the shape "identifier followed by a number" outright.
============================================================================

WHAT TRIGGERS A HARVEST
    Automatically: the SessionEnd hook in `.claude/settings.json` (once per
    Claude Code session in this repo), backed up by an optional post-commit
    hook for sessions whose cwd is elsewhere but which commit here
    (`--install-hook`). Both are best-effort and can never fail what they
    are attached to. Manually: `harvest`, any time.

⚠️⚠️ **THE TRANSCRIPTS ARE NOT DURABLE, AND THIS FILE USED TO SAY THEY
WERE.** It read "nothing is ever lost by not running it, because the
transcripts are the durable record and a harvest six months late still
recovers everything". That is FALSE: Claude Code deletes transcripts after
`cleanupPeriodDays`, which defaults to 30 and is unset here. Measured
2026-08-26 -- the oldest surviving tsmc65 transcript was 2026-07-28 while
the committed log reached back to 2026-07-10, so seven weeks of sessions
existed only in the log.

Two consequences, both paid for:

  * A REBUILD IS NOT SAFE. Acting on the old sentence, a rebuild-from-
    transcripts dropped 100 records naming real cells (`preamp` alone had
    24) and they were recoverable only because the log was committed.
    `retier` exists so a rule change can be re-derived for what is still
    reachable WITHOUT deleting what is not.
  * THE HARVEST HOOK IS LOAD-BEARING, not a convenience. When it was dead
    for 18 days in tsmc28 the gap happened to fall inside the retention
    window; a fortnight more and those attempts would have been gone for
    good. COMMIT the log -- it is the only copy past 30 days.

    """A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE of the unclassified backlog.

    ⚠️⚠️ **THE BACKLOG WAS DESIGNED AS AN UNBOUNDED CENSUS, WHICH IS WHY IT
    HAS NEVER BEEN STARTED.** Measured 2026-08-26: 343 unclassified across
    three repos, growing ~7.9/day. At a minute each the census is ~5.7
    hours AND you must sustain 8/day merely to hold even -- a chore that
    grows faster than it drains never gets a first hour spent on it, and
    the log has sat at 100% unclassified since it was built.

    A census is also not what the claims need. Everything this log is for
    -- "what fraction of attempts end in silent-pass", "offline iterations
    per cluster round trip" -- is a PROPORTION, and a proportion is what a
    sample estimates. n=40 puts a 50% rate inside about +/-15 points at
    95%; n=100 inside about +/-10. Classifying all 343 to learn the same
    number is work nobody owes.

    So: draw a fixed, reproducible sample, classify THAT, and let the rest
    stay honestly `unclassified` -- which this log already counts and never
    hides. The sample is written to runlog_sample.json with its seed and
    strata so the estimate is auditable: a proportion from a sample nobody
    can reconstruct is not evidence, and a sample chosen after seeing the
    records is not random.

    Stratified by (domain, tier) because those are the two axes the claims
    are about, and an unstratified draw of 40 from a population that is 76%
    analog can miss the digital cells entirely.
